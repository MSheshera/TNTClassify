**Abstract:**
This paper presents an unconventional method of segmenting non-text objects directly
from a grayscale document image by use of connected operators, combined with the
Otsu thresholding method, where the connected operators are realized as a 
maxtree. The maxtree structure is used for a simplification of the image 
and at a later stage, it is used as a structure from which to extract the 
desired objects. The proposed solution is aimed at segmenting halftone images, 
tables, line drawings and graphs. The solution has been 
evaluated and some of its shortcomings are highlighted. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first attempt at using connected operators for page 
segmentation.
